# Streamlit App Repository

This repository contains a Python application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source app framework for creating interactive web applications directly from Python scripts.

## Features
- Interactive and user-friendly web interface.
- Built using pure Python with Streamlit’s simple and declarative API.
- Ideal for showcasing data visualizations, machine learning models, or other Python-based tools.

## Requirements
Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git](https://github.com/Cyrus-spc-tech/streamlit_repo.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the App

To launch the Streamlit app, run the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Replace `app.py` with the name of the main Python file for your app if it differs.

This command will start a local web server, and the app will open in your default web browser. If it doesn’t open automatically, navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main script containing the Streamlit app.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the app.
- Additional files or directories (e.g., `data/`, `utils/`, `assets/`) as needed for the app.

## Customization
Feel free to modify the app script (`app.py`) or add additional features and functionality as needed. For more information on Streamlit’s capabilities, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/).

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug, have a feature request, or would like to improve the app, please submit an issue or a pull request.
